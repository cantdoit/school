What a regarded course, the homeworks are biweekly and the submission either by written or latex and I decided to use latex even though I have to learn how to use latex from scratch as well which makes me even more regarded
The fact that the work load is some of the worse that I have done because I have to learn everything in english... one must imagine themselves to be happy
